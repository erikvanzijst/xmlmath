	XMLMath 1.1


GETTING STARTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program evaluates mathematical, logical or textual expressions, described
in xml and prints the result. For example, to compute the result of 1 + 1, you
would write:

<add xmlns="http://xmlmath.org/1.0">
	<long value="1"/>
	<long value="1"/>
</add>

To evaluate this expression, save it in a file and run it through xmlmath.
Because xmlmath reads from standard input, you have to use a pipe. On unix or
linux, type the following:

	$ cat file.xml | java -jar dist/xmlmath-VERSION.jar

or:

	$ java -jar dist/xmlmath-VERSION.jar < file.xml

There are some interesting example files in the samples/ directory. Reading
and evaluating some of them to get familiar with xmlmath's "expression
language" would be a good starting point.
Once you have familiarized yourself with the basic concept, you can study
dist/manual/manual.pdf to learn more about xmlmath.
