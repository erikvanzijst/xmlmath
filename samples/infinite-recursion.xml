<!--
Stanzas are not like normal subroutines in programming languages that you can
call recursively. Instead, because stanzas substitute their referring <inline>
counterpart when the expression is being parsed, recursion is not possible.
Attempting to use a stanza recursively (or creating a circular reference
between different stanzas) will cause a StackOverflowError or OutOfMemoryError
being dumped to stderr while the expression is being parsed.

The expression below illustrates the problem of recursive stanzas: it crashes
during parsing.

Note that the example below would also fail in a normal programming language
due to the lack of a termination condition. However, the difference with
xmlmath is that xmlmath would still fail even with a proper termination
condition, because the expression parser crashes even before the evaluation
begins.
